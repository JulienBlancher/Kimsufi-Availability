# KIMSUFI AVAILABILITY
*Sends an email and a pushbullet notification when a Kimsufi server is available for sale*  

## How to use it?

Simply update the config on the top of the php file to match your own.  
By default, all Kimsufi servers are monitored. I didn't develop config for monitored servers yet, but you can add or remove one on line 45.  

Then, execute it with a cron for example, and enjoy ! :)
